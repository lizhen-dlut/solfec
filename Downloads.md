[Follow these instructions](http://code.google.com/p/solfec/source/checkout) in order to download the source code directly from the repository. Then use [the manual](http://solfec.googlecode.com/hg/doc/solfec.pdf) in order to learn how to set up and compile the code.

# Windows #

A recent binary (serial, debug) version of the code [is avaiable here](http://code.google.com/p/solfec/downloads/list) as a demonstration. Please read README.TXT after unpacking.

You can use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) in order to compile Solfec from sources as in the Unix case. (On MinGW you will need [portablexdr version 4.9.1](http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/portablexdr/) with this [patch](http://wiki.solfec.googlecode.com/hg/xdr_float.patch))
