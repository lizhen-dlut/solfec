# Other codes #

Here is a list of other software packages that can handle nonsmooth mechanical problems. Do not hesitate to contact us if you happen to know about relevant software not listed here, or if you would like to provide a more adequate summary of the listed software.

[DynamY](http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/dynamY/index.html) is a C++ class library for the simulation of mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction.

[LMGC90](http://www.lmgc.univ-montp2.fr/~dubois/LMGC90/index.html) is an open platform developped for the modelling of collection of mechanical elements in interaction including multi-physics. This is the reference implementation of Contact Dynamics, perhaps the most robust and well tested.

[Siconos](http://siconos.gforge.inria.fr/HomePage/about.html) software is dedicated to the modeling, the simulation and the control of Non Smooth Dynamical Systems (NSDS) with main applications to the nonsmooth Mechanics (impact, contact and friction) and the nonsmooth Electricity (diodes and MOS transistors).

[MBSim](http://mbsim.berlios.de/index.html) is a multi-body simulation software. Its purpose is the simulation of the dynamics of mechanical systems.
