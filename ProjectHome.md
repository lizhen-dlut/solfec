Solfec is a computational code aimed at simulation of multi-body systems with constraints. It implements an instance of the Contact Dynamics method by Moreau and Jean, hence the constraints are handled implicitly. One of the main goals of the software is to provide a user friendly platform for testing formulations and solution methods for the (dynamic) frictional contact problem. It is also meant to serve as a development platform for other aspects of time-stepping methods   (e.g. contact detection, time integration). The code implements several kinematic models (e.g. rigid, pseudo-rigid, finite element), few contact detection algorithms, several time integrators and a couple of constraint solvers. Solfec employs MPI and [Zoltan](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan/) in order to run in parallel. It exploits [Python](http://www.python.org) in order to interpret input files.


[These slides summarise the state of Solfec functionality as of 2012.](http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/NonSmoothMechanicsSeminars/BipopSummerSchool2012/mdTK.html) Currently (2014) Solfec is no longer in active development.  Some maintenance work is still done when necessary. Solfec repository has now been migrated to: http://github.com/tkoziara/solfec.
